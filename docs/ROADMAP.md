# Student Loan IDR MCP — Roadmap

## Product intent

Give an AI client a deterministic, inspectable way to normalize irregular taxable income, estimate current federal student-loan repayment options, and produce truthful supporting-statement templates without pretending to be a tax-return generator or official eligibility engine.

## V0.1 — Deterministic MVP — COMPLETE

- Cloudflare Worker + MCP JSON-RPC route.
- Strict TypeScript core.
- Variable-income normalization for hourly, weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, annual, and seasonal-lump income.
- 2026 HHS poverty-guideline table for contiguous U.S./D.C., Alaska, Hawaii, including household sizes above eight.
- RAP estimate including AGI bands, dependent reduction, and $10 monthly floor.
- IBR and PAYE discretionary-income estimates with optional modeled 10-year Standard cap.
- ICR income arm plus optional 12-year/factor arm when caller supplies the applicable official income-percentage factor.
- Supporting-statement templates for current taxable income, significant income change, unemployment compensation income, and no current taxable income.
- Tests, README, and Cloudflare deployment manifest.

## V0.2 — Policy correctness hardening — COMPLETE

1. Added the version-controlled 2026 ICR income-percentage-factor table, including deterministic linear interpolation, so callers do not have to supply the factor.
2. Added explicit loan-type/disbursement eligibility objects with `eligible`, `ineligible`, `conditional`, `mixed`, and `unknown` outcomes instead of relying only on warnings.
3. Added source-backed policy fixtures, including published 2026 ICR examples and a table-driven current Federal Student Aid loan-eligibility matrix.
4. Added the `policy_status` MCP tool reporting snapshot date, supported plans, known sunset dates, the ICR factor-table effective period, and source links.
5. Added scheduled/manual policy refresh that fingerprints four official policy sources and opens a review PR rather than silently changing constants. The initial fingerprint baseline was reviewed and merged through PR #1.
6. Hardened CI to require strict TypeScript, all deterministic tests, and a real `wrangler deploy --dry-run` bundle check.

Acceptance evidence:

- 21 deterministic policy/formula regression tests passing.
- Push CI + Wrangler acceptance run `33098442626` succeeded on commit `9a2c7de9c9e9e5d39428702107d9bf50e3417bd8`.
- Manual policy-refresh + full test/Wrangler run `33098620922` succeeded on the same commit.
- Policy source fingerprint baseline merged as commit `71dfd775d99b76d1857bd43e712a318ef3cb0cbd`.

## V0.3 — Document workflow — NEXT

- Add structured source-of-income arrays to template generation.
- Add Markdown + plain-text outputs.
- Add a privacy-safe printable HTML renderer.
- Add a checklist of commonly requested supporting evidence without asserting that any single item guarantees acceptance.

Acceptance: generated documents never invent facts and contain explicit placeholders for anything not supplied by the caller.

## V0.4 — Production MCP hardening

- Add protocol conformance tests.
- Add request-size limits and stricter schema validation.
- Add rate limiting / abuse controls if exposed publicly.
- Add structured observability without logging sensitive document content.
- Optional authentication if the service is used with real borrower data.

## Later / optional

- Small borrower-facing calculator UI.
- x402 paid access for agent-to-agent use.
- Policy change monitor that proposes reviewed constants updates.
- Multi-year policy snapshots for historical calculations.

## Explicit non-goals

- No automated filing or submission to Federal Student Aid.
- No generation of false pay stubs, tax forms, tax returns, dependents, deductions, or employer records.
- No guarantee of plan eligibility or servicer acceptance.
- No storage of SSNs or other borrower secrets in the MVP.
